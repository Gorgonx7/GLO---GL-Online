# VRProject
Opengl VR implementation targeted at the Oculus Rift

This is a game engine I wrote in pure C++ using OpenGL. It is also a networked application that will be capable of serving multiple people. I plan to implement OpenVR as well to add multiplayer VR experiences and a GUI eventually.

## What Works
The core engine has the data strucutres built in to render models to the screen, adding simulation scripts would be trivial but time expensive so networking will be focused on for now

## What doesn't work
VR at the moment still needs to be implemented, as does networking. refactoring of most of the code that is already there
